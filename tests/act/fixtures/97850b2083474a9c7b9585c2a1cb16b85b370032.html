		The above audio contains the following speech: We are going to the North Pole in this decade with puppies, not
		because they are easy, but because they are cute, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
		our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
		postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
